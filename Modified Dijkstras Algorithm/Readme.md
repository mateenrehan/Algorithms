# Modified Dijkstra's Algorithm

In this algorithm, I have implemeted Dijksta's algorithm which will check whether there is a single unique shortest path or there are multiple unique shortest path. This algorithm is very useful in networking field where we need to know if there exists another shortest path as it can provide you with backup and hence improve the reliability of the network.

## How to Run the program:

1. Clone or fork the repo.
