# Coin Change Algorithm

In this algorithm the input will the amount that needs to be changed and the denominations (for eg. 1,5,10,25 for US denominations). In the denominations you can give any denominations of your choice. The output will be minimum number of coins required to achieve the amount.

## How to Run the program:

1. Clone or fork the repo.

2. Verify that you have python installed by typing python --version. Python is installed by default on mac and linux machines. For windows users install python from https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/.

3. Now go in the folder/directory where the coin change algorithm is there and run the algorithm by typing python CoinChange.py. This will not give any output as I have not printed out anything. To get the output uncomment line 16-22.

4. There is also a test file included which you can run by typing python CoinChangeTest.py. This will run all the tests, you can also add new tests if you want.
